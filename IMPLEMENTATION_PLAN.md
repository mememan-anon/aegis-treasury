**Notes:**
- Time spent: ~30 minutes
- Initial commit: 519b9a8
- All branches created: main, dev, features
- README.md includes success criteria and one-page pitch

(C) Backend Agent + Relayer (Hours 18–30)
- Create backend skeleton (Node.js/TS) + package.json — Backend dev (0.5–1h)
- Implement on‑chain watcher (read balances + events) — Backend dev (2–3h)
- Implement price oracle integration (Chainlink testnet or mocked) — Backend dev (1–2h)
- Implement decision engine (rule‑based rebalancer: thresholds, targets) — Backend dev (3–4h)
- Implement proposal persistence (SQLite or simple JSON store) & API endpoints (list proposals, create, execute) — Backend dev (2–3h)
- Implement relayer worker (sign & submit txns) with env key handling (demo key) — Backend dev (2–3h)

(D) Frontend Dashboard (Hours 30–42)
- Scaffold React app + routing (Dashboard / Proposals / Controls) — Frontend dev (1–2h)
- Implement Dashboard (balances, target allocations, price charts) — Frontend dev (2–3h)
- Implement Proposals page (list, details, approve/execute buttons calling backend) — Frontend dev (2–3h)
- Integrate wallet display (WalletConnect for multisig demo or show relayer status) — Frontend dev (1–2h)
- Basic styling and status indicators (Pending / Executed / Failed) — Frontend dev (1–2h)

(E) Integration & Demo Prep (Hours 42–48)
- End‑to‑end test on local fork or BNB testnet — All (1–2h)
- Record demo GIFs/screenshots, finalize DEMO.md — Product/Frontend (1–2h)
- Final polish README and one‑page pitch — PM (0.5–1h)

Deliverables by end of Phase 1:
- Contracts with tests + deploy scripts
- Backend agent prototype and relayer
- Web dashboard to view balances and manage proposals
- Demo assets and submission one‑pager

Phase 2 — Competitive Stretch Goals (next 24–48 hours)
- Multisig/Gnosis integration for proposal approval (Backend + Frontend) — Backend + Frontend (4–8h)
- Add simple ML risk model (Python microservice) to adjust thresholds (volatility estimator) — ML/Backend (6–10h)
- Backtesting engine using historical data (indexer or The Graph) — Backend/Indexer (6–10h)
- Add monitoring/alerts (Discord/Telegram webhooks) — Backend (2–4h)
- Contract static analysis (Slither) + basic fuzz tests — Solidity dev (2–4h)
- Contract verification on block explorer (if deployed to public testnet) — DevOps (1–2h)

Phase 3 — Polish, Security & Submission (final 24 hours)
- UX polish, accessibility, responsive fixes — Frontend (2–4h)
- Security hardening: remove secrets, move relayer to env, review access controls — Solidity dev/DevOps (2–3h)
- Prepare submission materials: video, README, architecture, instructions to run demo — Product/PM (2–3h)
- Run a mock demo with team and fix any show‑stoppers — All (1–2h)
- Final deploy to public testnet (optional) and verify tx flows — DevOps (1–3h)

Phase 4 — Post‑Hackathon / Optional Next Steps
- Strategy marketplace & plugin system — Backend + Frontend (many hours)
- On‑chain governance automation (DAO proposal creation) — Backend (4–8h)
- Production readiness (key management, audits, scaling) — Security/DevOps (weeks)

Role mapping (who owns what)
- Solidity dev: Contracts, tests, contract security checks, deploy scripts
- Backend dev: Agent, relayer, watcher, API, persistence, integration
- Frontend dev: Dashboard, Proposals UI, wallet integration, demo UX
- ML / Data (optional): Risk model, backtesting aids
- DevOps / QA: Local fork/testnet setup, CI, deploy scripts, secret handling
- Product / PM: Demo script, README, pitch, issue management

Quick tips for pacing
- First 24 hours: focus on contracts + backend decision engine + simple UI to show one end‑to‑end flow.
- Next 24 hours: extend to multisig + backtesting, polish UI/design and create demo assets.
- Keep one person dedicated to the demo script and recordings (small, high‑polish video often wins).

If you want, I can now:
- Create the Phase 1 issue checklist as issues (or a task list) in the repo,
- Scaffold the repo with folders and template files for each area,
- Begin implementing the smart contract skeleton (TreasuryController, StrategyAdapter, Guardian) and push to your repo.
